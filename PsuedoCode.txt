1. Import necessary libraries
   - pandas for data handling
   - numpy for numerical operations
   - matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
   - sklearn for modeling (if necessary)

2. Data Acquisition
   - Load historical real estate data (e.g., prices, number of transactions)
   - Load current data (e.g., population migration, current listings, demand indicators)

3. Data Cleaning
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates
   - Ensure consistent formats across different data sources

4. Data Integration
   - Merge historical and current data into a single DataFrame
   - Ensure data is aligned by neighborhood and date

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Analyze trends in prices, sales volumes over time per neighborhood
   - Investigate patterns in migration data (e.g., increasing or decreasing populations)

6. Feature Engineering
   - Calculate indicators such as price per square foot, year-over-year growth in prices
   - Derive demand-supply ratio by comparing listings to sales volumes
   - Integrate external factors (e.g., economic indicators, crime rates, school district ratings)

7. Model Building (if applying machine learning)
   - Define target variable (e.g., future price growth)
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Select and train regression models to predict future prices
   - Validate model on test data

8. Analysis for Investment Recommendations
   - Use the model to predict future price growth by neighborhood
   - Rank neighborhoods based on predicted growth and other desirability factors (like low crime rates, high school ratings)

9. Visualization
   - Create maps showing recommended neighborhoods
   - Plot trends and predictions to visually analyze investment opportunities

10. Interpretation and Strategy Formulation
   - Summarize findings and suggest neighborhoods with the best investment potential
   - Discuss risk factors and confidence in predictions

11. Documentation
   - Document methodology, data sources, and model decisions
   - Prepare a presentation/report with findings and recommendations
